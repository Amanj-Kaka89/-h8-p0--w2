ALGORIRTHM:
1.Set the value of mass of objects in (kg)
2.Set the value of acceleration of objects(m/s2)
3.Calculate the multiplication of mass and acceleration
4.Set the result of the multiplication as resultant force
5.Display resultant force
________________
PSEUDOCODE:
STORE "mass of objects" with any numeric number (600)
STORE "acceleration of objects" to any numeric number (2)
STORE "resultant force" with and empty value

CALCULATE "mass of projects" multiply "acceleration of objects"
SET "resultant force" value equal to calculation result
DISPLAY "resultant force"

ALGORITHM:
1. Set year with any numeric number
2. Check whether the year mentioned is a leap year or not
   2.a: If the year runs out for 4 and does not run out for 100,then
        display that the year is a lean year
   2.b: If the year runs out for 4, finish at 100 and run out for 400
        then display that the year is a lean year
   2.c: If any other option diffrent with a and b then shows that year
        is not a lean year.

ALGORITHM:
1.Set any numeric value for maximum clothes foxie washes (20)
2.Set the value of counter starting from 0
3.Put the foxie clothes inside the washing mashine and count them in the same time. 
  for each one you put in the washing mashine.add one to counter
4.When all the clothes was put inside .turn on the washing mashine
_____________________________
PSEUDOCODE:
STORE "max washiong" with any numeric value.
STORE "counter" = 0
WHILE "counter" LESS THAN "max washing"
    DISPLAY "put more of your clothes inside the washing mashine","add one to counter for any clothes"
END WHILE

4.ALGORITHM:
1.Set the total number of students in class with any numeric number(40)
2.Set counter starting from 1
3.Make a rollcall to call all the students
4.Check whether the students's nails are long or not.
  4.a:check if the student's nails are long,then make a punihsment.
  4.b:check if the student's nails are short,then praise those students
counter increased by 1.
